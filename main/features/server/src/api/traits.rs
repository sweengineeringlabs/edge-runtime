//! SEA interface contract — top-level trait index for this crate.

/// Validates a value against domain constraints before it is used.
///
/// Implement this trait in `core/` to express invariants that cannot
/// be captured by the type system alone (e.g. non-empty strings,
/// numeric ranges, regex patterns).
